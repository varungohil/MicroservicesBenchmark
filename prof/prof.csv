David Albonesi,4.1,86%,3,Tough grader; Inspirational; Group projects; Respected; Clear grading criteria; Amazing lectures; Lecture heavy; Caring; Accessible outside class,"[['5.00', 'Christopher Batten', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1908365'], ['5.00', 'David Williamson', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=743632'], ['5.00', 'Francesco Monticone', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2312627']]","Will spend time with you in OH to just chat. Very willing to help students. Class is quite easy to understand.; Very clear lecture and grading criteria, extremely organized. Prof. Albonesi teaches so well that there is no need to read the textbook. Homeworks are well designed and those are the questions you'd get on the exams. Best ECE professor I've met!; Lectures were sometimes impossible to follow either because the slides were far too vague or he moved too fast to be able to internalize the information being sprayed at us. Any notes taken on the slides by the professor were never uploaded even though multiple request were made to do so. Felt like an under-prepared power point presentation.; Im not an ECE major so I was initially very confused during lectures. But the prof has individual office hour and that helped clear things up a lot. Hes really helpful and easily accessible outside the classroom (email him and hell respond to you in no time). I gotta admit I grew to be very interested in computer engineering after the class.; Maybe the best professor I've ever met in Cornell, explanations are clear and notes help a lot! The labs are a bit hard though.; Albonesi is a kind, caring professor. The beginning of this course was very clearly laid out in his lecture notes, but the computer organization portion required extra time outside of the class to really learn. That said, his tests were beyond fair and I plan on taking another course with him next semester.; Notes are amazing.; His notes are ECE 2300 Bible, follow them and you can't fail!; Clear, well-organized lectures, though not super interesting.  Labs are incredibly time consuming but also helpful.  They will teach you the material and prepare you for later classes.  Homework was manageable but not something to write off.  Tests were very fair- tested class material well.  Easy to get an A.; Best prof ever!; Excellent professor!  Spent a lot of time making clear and useful lecture PPTs.  He is an excellent lecturer, spoke very clearly and precisely.  Very fair policies, exams, and grading.  Take 2300 with him!; Best professor I have had at Cornell! His lectures are basically what made me interested in computer architecture. Though he may not be the most interesting lecturer, he is extremely straightforward and is very genuinely helpful. He's an awesome person outside of class as well and I look forward to asking him for help/advice in the future.; I really liked this guy. His lectures were very clear and he posts his lecture notes online, which are PPT slides that compliment the textbook well. This class is time consuming, but to no fault of the professor. Homework isn't too bad, but some of the pre-labs can take forever. Still, make sure you do them. Otherwise, you won't get out of lab.; A really nice guy who explains things well. Lectures are good and tests are fair. Prelabs take a long time and are somewhat difficult.; Tests were fair and were based mostly on lecture, practice exams were extremely helpful in preparing for the prelims/final; Will admit that it isn't a very interesting lecture, but it isn't too difficult to follow. Prof is super nice though and if you have any questions about the course or need help, he is extremely willing to work with you.; Not an extremely exciting lecturer -- the 75 minute blocks really tended to drag. But his lectures are at least clear, and between classes and the online slides, I had little trouble grasping the material. Tests, homework, and projects were not difficult. Very nice, and very willing to answer questions.; worst professor I have ever had at Cornell; His class is so boring and it is a perfect chance for those of you who want to have a sweet nap on Monday and Wednesday afternoon. He never explained anything because all he does is reading the lecture slides that directly come from the textbook.",19

He organizes lecture in a clear manner and always tries to keep it interactive so you don't fall asleep learning a ton of math. Projects in the second half of the course are extremely well designed and educational; however, they are very challenging. Exams and problem sets were also difficult.; Was the most interesting ECE class I've taken yet. The class takes all the theory from ECE3250 and ECE3100 and let's you use it to do interesting things. Prof. Wagner is clear and quite friendly. There is only one prelim. Don't screw it up or your grade will suffer. The final project (OFDM through a box) is really cool.; Great professor!; Excellent, if a bit quirky, lecturer. Really cares about students. Extremely helpful.

Basically followed the book word-for-word. Homework assignments and lab reports were a pain. As long as you study the material, the prelims aren't difficult.; No Comments; Lots of work, but overall a good class; she knows her stuffs.  And when I took this class, she is really good.  She gives lots of help and I simply choose my career path after taking her class. I want to do what she does.; She's smart, no doubt about that...but she lacks coherence, organization and enough of an intuitive approach to teach the class...she expected students to know way too much; homeworks and test are long and difficult; labs are worthless and she's very inconsiderate of students' time; don't take it; She's a smart woman, but she REALLY doesn't know how to teach. Her ""lectures"" are just straight out of the text. Homework takes too long, and class isn't exactly a walk in the park. She isn't that helpful either unless you hound her with questions.; Very difficult class.  Lecture consists of reciting the book... better off just reading it instead.  She has a very heartless and uncompassionate personality.  Final project expectations were ridiculous for time given to us.  I hate analog design now because of this class.; She is one of the greatest teachers that I ever had!; she's actually very nice in lab, knows her stuff and is willing to help. she's not that good at lecturing, but definitely someone who makes an attmept to help her students.; She's better that Lal at lecturing and she helps alot in lab...doesn't seem very approachable, sorta serious personality but once you ask her for help she'll be sure you understand what you're doing; I can't believe how bad the two professors for this course are.  how do they expect us to learn anything from such an important class when we don't have any good professors or ta's?; No Comments; No Comments",13

I wish I dropped the class; he has an accent, and his handwriting isn't the best.  that said if you don't understand something, just ask him!  he encourages this.  I was initially put off by these things, but after a few weeks I realized he is always open to clarification.  Awesome guy, very fair grader, wants his students to succeed.; ECE 4800. awesome professor with sound theoretical knowledge. His assignments, mid term and final totally make you understand what is happening and how the theory is applied in real life applications.; ECE 5950 Parallel Computing. He knows the material well. Hes lectures are really fun to go to. Material requires deep understanding, but tests are not hard, and homework assignments are broad but not difficult.  Highly recommended, especially with interest in multi-threadingprocessing, parallellizaion and modern  large scale computing. CUDA includ; Bojanczyk is probably one of the worst lecturers I have ever encountered. The classes are completely incoherent, with Bojanczyk simply reading off slides in a monotonous, sleep-inducing voice. The book is better than the professor, who has not really improved my understanding of the subject. Do not take this class unless your major requires it.; I came into ECE 2300 with no experience in Digital Logic. This professor has not really improved my understanding of the material even from the very beginning of the course. I can't ever understand what he is saying. The prelims are absolutely nothing like any of the practice questions. insanely too much work in this course. Don't take it!!!; I learned the whole course on my own unfortunately.; Knows his stuff, but not good at conveying it. Lectures move very quickly and he's not clear in his lectures. Assumes prior comfort with math. Lectures were harder than the prelims. Labs were worthwhile -- they helped visualize the material in Matlab.; Had him for engrd230+ece220. He is a good prof, hard to understand at times. Assignements help a lot. His exams are based on practice exams he posts. He is better for 230 than 220.; This guy can't teach for live. But his prelims were really easy, and they were exactly like his practice prelims. I got two A+ from him, so I guess I shouldn't complaint too much; A great ECE professor.  He has a very good grasp of the material, but might not explain it the best way.  From my experience, the material comes to him with such ease that he expects to be trivial.  Prelims are very similar to the practice problems that he gives.; one of the nicest teachers i have had.  Always willing to help.; Probably one of the teachers who is most willing to help.  He provides so much practice material for the exams, pretty much giving away the exam.  If you study what he gives you, there's no reason why you shouldn't get a perfect score.  Just don't hand in assignments late, and you'll be fine.; After getting used to his accent and the speed of lecture, he's actually very good.  This class is computational methods in ECE, which is his area of research, which is why this class is probably taught better than ECE 230. Nice guy too.; No Comments; His lectures were often unorganized and he had errors in his power point presentations that would surprise him.  But he gave the impression of a jolly Russian Santa Claus meets Gorbachev.  And you can't get mad at that no matter how painful the test.; Not very easy to understand; No Comments; No Comments",19

Basically has an open door all the time for students. Clearly knows everything there is to know about MIMO/OFDM/Wireless Communications in general. I had him during my 9th semester at Cornell. He was one of the top three best professors I had.; Excellent lecturer, answers questions during lecture.  Always available during office hours.  Very patient.  I would highly recommend!; Professor Studer's friendliness and good character is well matched by his intelligence. He will kindly dedicate time to make sure you understand and will further inspire you to think beyond the topics. As a research advisor, he will spend a lot time with you, and give you great ideas. In my opinion, he is super hot.; Great class and the professor cares about students; Great professor!! Fair grader, especially with exams that seem pretty difficult while you take them. Lots of partial credit if you give a good effort. Overall, a very useful class to take. Also, Prof. Studer is super helpful and goes out of his way to help students with any questions they might have.; Great professor. Really nice guy. Can be tough on grades but generally fair.

Although the material itself is not always very exciting, he presents clear arguments about everything he is teaching, and thus makes the content more interesting and applicable.; Prof Kline keeps the potentially boring subject of technological history interesting by focusing upon the use/human-driven perspective of history rather than the much overused technologically driven view of history.  A short writing assignment is due every friday and the majority of your grade consists of 3 papers.; Great; I love prof. Kline- he's a cute old man, esp when his hair is messy. He makes the history very interesting- showing all perspectives, including politics with no bias at all. Very, very interesting readings, and papers were actually sort of enjoyable to write. Grades fairly for sure- do a good job, get your facts straight and you'll get a good grade; Made the subject matter very interesting, surprisingly enough. Is obviously expert in his field and is eager to help anyone who shows interest. Very professional and a real gentleman. This is a great history course for anyone, engineer or not.; Excellent prof, cares very much about his students.  Go to office hours, take advantage of all Prof. Kline has to offer.  You will take a lot away from his class - well worth your efforts.; A genuinely good guy.; Interesting lectures.

For example he would refuse to give out even homework solutions. Also he even flat out refused to answer students' questions about grading because according to him ""it's not productive to wonder about your grades""; Funny guy and decent lecturer, but super lazy. He literally canceled several lectures for no reason. And he absolutely refused to give out practice prelims and homework solutions for studying. Also he (probably deliberately) left important parts of his lecture slides blank. You have to pay attention in lecture and work a lot on your own.; Great professor! I had him for ECE2400 and I learned a lot from him. Very secure and he definitely knows his stuff. If you want to learn, this is the professor you want to take; on the other hand if you want an easy A, I recommend going somewhere else because Professor Martinez is going to make you work for it.; The class was quite challenging but really interesting. Exams were really difficult but if you understand the lectures properly you should be okay. The professor is very passionate about the material and thats really inspiring. Overall, very helpful class. Learned a lot.; Funny and engaging lectures. Few caveats: lecture notes are sparse and assignments cover a fraction of material. First assignments were quite straight forward, last were quite time consuming. Exams were very difficult due to lack of material provided for prep. Overall, very rewarding class - learn all of CS 2110 and more. Take this class ECEs.; Martinez is a great teacher, he knows his stuff! Class wasn't too much work at all, there are roughly weekly quizzes, two prelims and no final. The only problem was that he had really sparse lecture notes, so you had to pay close attention in class and take good notes to do well. Overall, I would recommend taking a class with him.; Acts menacing, and is menacing. Explains concepts clearly in lecture (you MUST go to lecture), but labs can be near impossible. Tests are very tricky, and practice is not relevant: you need a good intuition to do well on the exams. Learned a lot from the class, okay professor; Exams are not fair, labs are tedious and boring, avoid this prof for 2300.; The course is not supposed to be difficult but this guy manages to make it very painful. The labs are extremely tedious, if not impossible. Also, he does not put emphasis on what we should know in order to prepare for labs and exams. I was completely fooled as this guy put prelim1 date after the drop period. He is very harsh too.; This guy is completely under-appreciated. Although I had him for my engineering 1050, and he showed up maybe twice and made his TA organize everything.  For 2300 (the class that mattered), he was the exact opposite, he was very clear with his lectures and tried to make sure everyone understood the material. So far 2300 has been my favorite class.; Bad prof; Not the most friendly person. Very strict when it comes to deadlines. Not given enough time to have even a slight chance of finishing prelim. intimidating to speak to, as if he looks down on his students.; always seems angry. Hard prelims.

Professor wasn't very helpful over the course of the project, as his bias towards medical apps of computer vision and certain techniques are clear.  Gives students a hard time, but seems to give good grades to those who deserve them.; Reeve's is an absolute Professional when it comes to working with students and helps them to succeed when they are failing.; The reason there is such a disparity among these ratings is that there were two lectures taught by this prof. and Victor Aprea. I switched up which lecture i went to sometimes, and they were both good.; It's hard for me to rate him, because he got some grad student to teach lecture instead of him, even though he was still listed as professor. Needless to say, that did not make for a very good semester. The course is very difficult.; Abysmally-bad ECE professor who is completely unaware of the course curriculim, doesn't care about students understanding the material, uses someone else's power-point slides without even checking to see what's on them and if they're relevant.; He is an excellent lecurer. Made the class intersting by showing how the material applies to real world applications.; He definitely knows his stuff. Having a large class meant little interaction with students, and although he would tend to lose his place from time to time, he's one of the better overall lecturers I've had at Cornell.; Reeves had absolutely no interaction with his 314 class, as far as I could see.

Suh's assignments and exams have been extremely fair.; Not too much work until the end of the semester.

His lecture slides do not clear up information very well and are filled with abbreviations for terms that aren't explained.; Unclear and boring lectures. You will likely spend hours debugging labs. Lecture attendance isn't technically mandatory, but he gives pop quizzes every other week or so. There will be a point in the semester when you have an assignment due every weekday, none of which are easy or timely. Tests are very difficult.; Very unclear and disorganized lectures.

He was a little mean when it came to prelim conflicts, workload and stuff but overall he was really good. And the grad TA's were awesome.

Take in other sem if possible; his exam is the most unclear one i've ever seen. units are all mixed up, no or minimal diagrams provided, and the question is absolutely poorly worded. doesn't follow textbook, and invents his own symbols that has nothing to do with the textbook. then he threw this temper fit during one prelim and refused to answer any questions.; He's a nice guy... but his exams DON'T MAKE SENSE...; Nice guy and all but he rambles on and drifts off during lecture. You might as well just read the book  on your own and hope you get a T.A. Thats accomadating and helpful. If you go to lecture anyway, bring a sandwich or the paper, you'll need something to pass the time.; Annoying.; Lectures are just verbatim from the book.  He also seems to get confused sometimes and will talk to himself.; He tries very hard to explain the information to the best of his ability, but sometimes gets confused early in the morning... but quite helpful if you ask questions right after the lecture.; I came out of lecture knowing less than when I went in.  Thus, I stopped going to lecture, and my grades immediately improved.; Not bad.  Sometimes not the best lecturer, but going to section will usually clear up most problems.",14

Class was a shock for freshmen.; Worst professor I've had at Cornell. Makes me appreciate the mediocre ones I had. Will absolutely turn off your interest in the subject. Unfair grader.

His lecture is always inspiring, and he genuinely cares for his students. TAs, classmates, and just the spirit of the class is amazing. It is a VERY heavy workload class (like a solid 10 hours per week just on coding projects on average), but it will be fun if you love programming.; Probably the best professor and class ive taken at Cornell. Also the hardest class Ive taken, but the amount you learn is well worth it. The compiler project is no joke and extremely fuffiling.; Prof. Myers' courses are extremely difficult, but his lectures are excellent and you will never learn more in such a short time as in his class. He is also friendly in Office hours, if you have any questions about the course. Take his class if you want to be challenged like never before.; He put in a special effort in remembering everyone's name, and that's really something. Extremely organized lectures. Exams were fair. Projects were hard (120 hours of coding for the whole semester). Lots of fun.; Professor Myers is knowledgeable and his lectures are amazing. He might get a bad rep because his classes are hard, but hes extremely helpful and is always willing to answer your questions either after class or during office hours. And if you cant make it to his office hours, he has a website where you can book an appointment with him.; Really hard but one of the best teachers I've ever had.; I love the guy so much. He's a genius.  Don't mix up the courses with the teacher. Let's separate the two:  Professor Myers is: Well spoken, focuses on big picture, focuses on good programming, understands everything. Nice.  The classes he teaches are: honors/heavy duty CS courses at Cornell University. HW is 10+ a week. Lube is advised.; 2112 is plenty of work, but well worth it if you love CS.; Good teacher. Explains well and helpful if you ask for clarification. Assignments are long but the grading is quite generous.; Lectures were always very clear and interesting and were a good learning experience. Taking the honors course resulted in a hefty load with seemingly unreasonable projects and deadlines. In the end was worth it. Prof. Myers was always very helpful when we had questions as was the rest of the course staff. Take this course if you want a challenge!!; This class is simply way too hard.  Problem sets in this class are longer and more tedious than comparable 300 level computer science classes, and the TA's grade them in the most anal retentive unforgiving manner possible.  Myers is a pretty good lecturer, but don't let him organize the assignments.; Nice guy, tries to explain things. Projects are WAY too long!!!!!!; Don't take his course if you want an easy ride! His classes are tougher than almost anything else you'll spot in college. And yet, if you need help, he's always there to help. Plus, if you survive the course load, I got more out of his courses than any other class.; If you like to stay up nights and programming for over 30 hours at a time, have fun with this class.  personally i think he's on the crazy side of cs.; Above average teacher but not amazing.  He hates C with a passion so do not get into an argument about programming languages with him.; Likes to focus more on the logistics (comments, specifications, etc) of programming rather than the actual code itself.  Has very long complicated projects.  Class concepts are obtuse and difficult to understand.",16

If you like a course, reconsider taking it if he's teaching.  He maybe nice to you, but when push comes to shove, he's a terrible human being from the soul.; The professor is really unhelpful and the assignments are way off the topics that are discussed during the class. Really unorganized class material.; The professors has difficulty in communicating the theory and also the home work is much more unorganized; I found the classes were not structured properly. The professor does not teaches the basics and in case you have a query , he is not able to explain the queries in a proper mathematical manner; take this class only if you have taken other ai classes before. instructor assumes you know the basics. i had hard time catching up.; Does not have the best teaching skills. But wonderful for research discussion related to class project. He comes up really quickly with examples to explain the hardest concept. Strongly recommended if interested in robotics. Best roboticist the Cornell has to offer.; I was so interested in this course prior to attending Cornell.Sad that I would not be taking this course again. The classes were vague and the professor has problems in communicating.; Classes were confusing and material used was not very relevant. Bad experience. Not going to take again; I had taken many courses in the AI vector at Cornell. This class used many algorithms and discussed applications to robotics. I really liked the way homeworks were designed that helped understand the material and how to apply it.; I really loved machine learning, and this class's applications on robots connected my theoretical understanding to reality. The lectures on Kalman Filters and Reinforcement Learning were fun, although it helped to prepare a bit in advance before the lecture.; Very helpful in class projects. Had fun!; The rant I just wrote for my course eval was double the size allowed here. Suffice to say Saxena is horrible. I had him for CS 6758 last semester and should have known better. Say away. 0/10 stars. Would not take again.; Easily, the worst professor I have ever had. He never gave a single helpful lecture or comment. He also doesn't listen to students...it's like talking to a wall.; He seems to be a good researcher, but he just cannot teach. He cracks pathetic jokes. Has problems while communicating, rather than sticking to slides, he wastes times around the blackboard. I agree with earlier reviews, probably not the best one Cornell has to offer, sadly not even average.; Jesus tap dancing Christ! I can't agree more with the previous comment. This guy is the worst professor I have had so far by a long shot. Lectures are useless, he does not know how to explain the material. He uses another prof.s notes, no textbook. HW is a huge time drain. Not helpful at all.; Worst professor at Cornell. No exceptions. Cannot lecture, test, produce homeworks, grade or use proper mathematical language well.

Hands down.; he was a great lecturer; Great lectures are run like a large discussion, but often don't describe topics comprehensively enough for full coverage.  He really stimulates interest in OS though. Exams and grading are very hard.  Treat the lecture and prac as 4 credits each in terms of work load.; Confusing lectures, need to read textbook...; Such an excellent class and Prof. Sirer is a phenomenal lecturer. He knows the material very well and if you go to class, read the book, and spend time on the assignments.. you will do fine. Exams are brutal, but the workload is not too bad. Overall, great course.. but don't expect to get an 'A' grade.; Topics are in general interesting. Projects are enjoyable. However, project description is always vague (clarification is even 2 * longer than original description). Grading sometimes doesn't follow description quite well.; eee; I loved cs316. Corewars was awesome.; 316 may be better than 314, but is very hard. Gun likes to skip 314 material and cover 50% of 414.  Gun _tries_ very hard to engage the class.  He's also the only professor I know who has a huge ego to accompany his 'l33t h4x0r ski11z'.  He can tend to be terribly unhelpful.  Work hard; he expects genius.  Behold the preppiest CS professor alive.; This class was supposed to be the most time intensive core EE/CS course. For some reason, the 4 killer projects got shrunk to 2 (3rd optional) which covered the first 2 of the 4 topics. The last project was supposed to be so hard it took the place of a final.  We ended up having to copy diagrams from our texts. Could have been cool. Was not.; Excellent. Made me decide to pursue systems.; excellent course. the prof. was dedicated to clarifying the material. learned more in this course than all others combined. never mind the person complaining about the project. there were three projects, first and third were awesome, the second was identical to a part of last year's.; This professor screwed up ECE 314. This course was destroyed because there was no project. This was blamed on ""not being able to install the software."" How can you not be able to install software?? This professor was lazy and not organized. He stopped giving HW in October! Writes too small on the board, very unclear. Worthless.; This was a challenging course, where the prof. was dedicated to clarifying issues in class. Prof. Sirer had another prof. take over for him, but cut him some slack - he said it was due to a family emergency. Overall, a memorable class where I learned a lot.; I wish the guy showed up for class more often.; Very disorganized, unprepared.Sirer did practically nothing except show up- sometimes. He doesn't know anything about the projects he reuses. And he likes to spring surprises on you (some good, some bad), like changing exam dates at the last moment, and making it closed-book and 2 1/2 hours long.; Lectures were really bad at the beginning of the semester, disorganized, unclear. Improved towards the end. Final project was a killer, as it was due in the middle of finals week. Granted it was his first time teaching the class. Very helpful and friendly professor.; The class started off terribly, but as the semester moved on and he started showing up to class things improved dramatically. His lecturing skills could use some work, but in the end his grading is fair (even generous) and you'll have learned something.; He isn't strong with the A/D circuit portion of the course, but he is very clear on the CS material. His lectures became great when he put away the aged powerpoint slides and started teaching with the blackboard. It's a shame that there was a month left of class when he did that.",19

It got me excited about diverse medical fields. Ramin didn't lecture himself but behind the scenes, organized group of practicing physicians from Weill Cornell medicine. Every session was a case study and explored a field. The session on lung cancer made me quit smoking. So this class extended my life span by 10 years!; I did not like the lack of organization on the HWs and exams. TAs write the HWs and half of each exam. I was told the class gets harder every year. With 5 minutes left on each prelim, we got 15-30 extra minutes, but no extra time on the final, so don't expect it all the time. Overall, that made me feel a lack of trust. Do well on the final.; His first time teaching in years.  Lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final.  Problem Sets were managed solely by the TAs.  Prelims were fine.  Grade in class is almost solely based on final, as stated by email afterwards.  He's a decent person, but do try to stay away as far as class goes.; Extremely careless about classes. Lecture notes are updated 1 month later (Those for the finals haven't been updated yet).; Ramin is amazing! Extremely interesting lectures. Really knows his stuff. Enthusiastic about the subject. Best CS class I have taken. You really learn a lot about CS rather than just programming.; Incredible class. Ramin makes intro CS extremely interesting. While other CS100 classes were doing mind-numbing pointless programming assignments, we  actually learned useful CS applications and picked up the programming as we went.; Ramin is a God. Being taught by a genius like this is a true blessing.; Taking 312 with Ramin really kindled my interest in CS.  He's a dynamic and lucid lecturer, with a flair for the material.  His exams were engaging, the homework was interesting and manageable.  I hear good things about machine vision, but can't comment from personal experience.; Took class Fall 1996.  Funny guy.  Once asked the students why they took a 9AM lecture.  (um, we were freshmen, we had little choice.)  Exams and assignments were difficult but fair.; 312 students should complain about the material, not the teacher.  this guy was really great in machine vision- great sense of humor and definitely one of the top 5 lecturers in the cs dept; He managed to make lectures confusing even without using PowerPoint.; Course textbook: Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Variable names Ford, Arthur and HHGTG were common. Lots of intel references. On a whole, really liked his teaching style. Wierd, geeky humor.; Went on personal rants all the time, and didn't really teach us much about the material. Extremely hard to get a hold of, and the grading was a constant mess. I will avoid him in the future.; Clear, thought-out lectures. Coursework can be demanding, and tedious at times. Has a strange pechant for THHGTTG.; Given that the material is difficult, Ramin is pretty good at explaining it.  He could be better; sometimes his examples too quickly, and his explanations are not always direct.  He will, however, make you understand all the major concepts.; Conceited; the class is marked by arrogant speeches that sound as if he's doing the students some kind of enormous favour by teaching them. He's very hard to get a hold of outside of class, a disorganized lecturer, and the coursework is extremely hard.; Ramin is a VERY dedicated teacher, he takes the class very seriously, and he's an interesting lecturer.

Thom (as he signs his emails) is an interesting guy teaching a *very* dry subject. Intro stats can be memorized, which makes it pretty boring.

Has hilarious comments he'll make during class. 2100 is hard b/c of material, not b/c of him.; Lecture's are pretty standard, a bit fast paced at first, but settles down as the semester progresses. Problem sets are biweekly, but very long. Labs also take a very long time and are often confusing. Exams are very easy; he gives you very explicit hints to the content of the exams before hand since 2100 covers so much material.; He's a nice guy and is always willing to help you out. That said, lectures are hopelessly fast paced, he treats corequisites as prerequisites, and blows through a 2-3 semester texbook in one.; An extremely challenging professor. Lectures left me lost and confused every time with difficult exams. Homework and lab reports took forever. Some labs were interesting, but the class was a nightmare overall.; Shealy is ridiculously smart. Definitely a genius.; Shealy is the MAN. He teaches you how to think like an engineer. His tests are a bit tough but if you have the intuition they're easy. I just wish he'd teach every ECE class because that would be sick; The course, the book and Shealy's teaching attitude/ability left me with a feeling that a large part of my tuition money has been spent by Dick Shealy on pregaming before the lectures. The guy is smart, but makes no effort to teach the class. The amount of information this course covers is ridiculous. Labs and homeworks are devices for torture!; Definitly a genious. Funny. Has pride in GaAs, but from what I hear, it sucks!~ Always complained that the prof of the class before him wrote too high~! Says he was in a frat; Totally disastrous class. You definitely have to read the textbook to keep up with him. His exams are killer - the only way to survive is to make a super comprehensive ""cheatsheet"" to bring into exam, and just copy every crap on ur cheatsheet onto the exam.; Bad temper. Has half a bottle of whiskey on him before going to lab. Makes exams insanely hard. Is a freaking genius. Willing to help, as long as he is in a good mood. But a nice guy none the less.; This class is probably a hard class itself, and it's not Shealy's fault.  A lot of notes to copy,and material is covered very quickly, probably because Shealy expects everyone to be as smart as him.  But I have to say, he IS a very smart prof. An intellectually stimulating course.; He doesn't know how to calculate standard deviation of an exam =P there's no way that the SD of a prelim is 44.; It is true that ECE 315 is among the hardest course in ECE department..and you will hate shealy after the first prelim. But if you ask for help (be sure to say no if you don't understand), shealy is extremely helpful. after taking the course, you will learn a lot and realize shealy is a great prof; Knows his stuff but is really hardcore.  He always made me laugh so that made a hard class a little easier in lecture.  Don't blame Shealy, 315 is a hard hard class.  Plus I drank with him one night at the 9s.  Classic.; Horrible class! He goes through the material at break-neck speed and then blames US for not knowing the material well! He thinks every one of us majors in ECE 315 but he's sadly mistaken.

As a graduate student doing research in this field, I find that all the materials discussed in this class very helpful. Prof. Monticone is very knowledgeable and nice. I always enjoy the in-depth research discussions with him.; Well, his classes so far covered very specific topics--mostly related to his research interests--but he did an excellent job to engage students into those topics very naturally. He is really solid in organizing and pacing the class--not too fast and not too slow. It was great that he connects the class materials to classic or frontier researches.; The class was ideal for covering modern electromagnetism topics, and was the exact extension I needed to fill up the gap between fundamentals and application. Prof. Monticone is a great lecturer and is very knowledgeable about the subject. His notes have been very helpful, and I understand a lot more about the subject.; As a graduate student specializing in the field of metamaterials this class was a great at filling up different gaps that I had in my knowledge of the subject. Professor Monticone did a terrific job at simplifying complicated concepts with concise examples. His choice of subjects for the class was on point.; I enjoyed ECE4960 thoroughly. The course material is very interesting and of major present research interest. Francesco is very patient and helpful during office hours. The course material is intrinsically quite challenging, but I think Francesco did a good job of selecting homework and exam problems of appropriate difficulty.; Professor Monticone is a great professor. He has high standards but is also encouraging. He was really invested in whether or not I understand the material during office hours, and he's one of the best professors I've hard at Cornell from a social perspective. The material was complex, but it was doable with Monticone's patient and consistent help.; ECE 4960 is one of the best courses that I have taken at Cornell. This course perfectly connects the theory with the application. Moreover, Prof. Monticore is a very good and easy-going teacher. He explains the math precisely and his lecture notes are very clear and helpful. He always welcomes us to discuss homework problems with him.",19

Definitely gonna take his class 3250 next sem!; Amazing lecturer who writes fun, challenging, and useful homeworks. Tests are easy enough that if you understand the course material well, you're very likely to do well.; Snitch, always out there to hurt and back-stab his own students. Do not trust him with any questions he asks or responds to, and always-always record him. He ruined multiple students life and career for his personal interests. Don't take his classes, and if you are wronged by all means then file a complaint against him.; Lectures are confusing, he kept writing every single word he said on the board. Few people can catch up with his notes. Once you lost track of what's going on, the rest of the lecture becomes a waste of time. TAs are not quite helpful.; Delchamps is really a great professor and you should really try to take a class with him (especially 3250), but his organization of 4250 was a bit messy. We had 2 problem sets the whole semester which made it very difficult to learn the material otherwise. Project for the course was a lot of fun.; One of the most caring and kind professors at Cornell. Lectures always designed to reflect the class's level of understanding of the material. Answers emails and Piazza questions very quickly. Exams are challenging, but studying past exams is extremely helpful and will guarantee that you will do well.; Homework and exam require techniques that are not straightforward from what was taught in class. One must have a creativity and strong background in linear algebra.; Great teacher with amazingly thorough understanding of all the material. Always responds to emailsquestions and cares for his students. Also one big plus - homework deadlines were lax; THanks to Professor Delchamps all my other clases for my MEng came so simple. If there is a class I can remember as memorable, this is the one. How could he simply get to the blackboard and deliver his class without notes just blew my mind. When we had questions he answered in a simple way easy to understand. Thanks Prof Delchamps.; I took his class 24 years ago and his course remains the most important engineering course in my career as a surgeon and co-inventor of Rebiscan.  The overall concepts of input / output systems was delivered second to none. It was that beer he bought for me at the Palms and told me to seek advanced degrees that changed my life.; Awesome; Probably the greatest professor I've had at Cornell, highly recommend both him and the course (ENGRI 126) to anyone interested (or not interested, it was that good!) in any kind of electrical engineering or computer science or communications in general.; This is the third semester that I've had Professor Delchamps.  His style is the best I've had at Cornell.  He always gives a lot of examples and he makes the topics very easy to understand - as long as you can keep up in the notetaking and listening (which; Great guy. Class was good too.; Totally awesome teacher.  Had super clear lecture notes and very neat writing on the boards.  Extremely organized.  Overall a great teacher!; the most helpful professor i've ever known. this ECE course that i took from him however was not related in any way to ECE, and seemed to stray a bit from the topic of the course. He likes math.; Class notes extremely organized and puts all the information you need on the black board with super-fast chalk writing, exams based on homework, if you do well on homework you'll do well in the class.; Between the baggy jeans and 18 year old ski bum wannabe look, he's the best engr. professor at cornell.  very helpful, kinda ghetto, very smart, and he signs on AIM to help his students.  brilliant guy.  some bad jokes, some good ones.; Took in SP02 when lab separate. funny guy who tries his best. emphasizes math, NOT concepts. at end of course, knew how to do useless math but knew jack about circuits.  hated it for that reason. but this class made me physics instead of ECE so thx dude.",19

The class was tough for me because of my skill level in the subject but I truly enjoyed attending his lectures. The material taught was conceptually stimulating and enjoyable to attempt to master. I would definitely take one of his courses again.; Best 1910 lecturer this year. I switched into his class after attending a few of his lectures. He truly cares about his students and portrays the information in a learnable way. He is the type of teacher that wants all his students to be successful and is by far the best STEM teacher I have had at Cornell. Definitely focus on textbook practice.; Carl is a really great professor and definitely the best lecturer for 1910. He gives it to you straight and doesn't have unreasonable exam expectations (even if he's not the one writing it). He is a very compassionate guy and will take the time to answer questions in class or have extra office hours if necessary. Take his class!!; Carl is a great professor.

I worked with microcontrollers before, I still learned a lot from the class. Teach more classes Prof. Poitras! Thank you ECE!; I took MAT 2930 with Professor Poitras and I was so happy that he was teaching this course. Math was never easy for me and he made the material easy to get and actually fun! Great great lectures, he understands the students point of view, answers questions clearly. Thank you!!!; I am taking MAT1910 this semester, online. It's a large class and we have many sections taught by different professors. Prof. Poitras' lecture is by far the best, clear, fun, makes me love math and i didn't really before. Thank you. Teach more classes Prof. Poitras!; Poitras is by far the best professor for 1910. He clearly is very passionate about teaching and explains difficult concepts very simply. Many CoE students in lectures with other professors have started watching Poitras instead. He is clear and concise, while still explaining everything fully. He is kind and caring, as well as very engaging.; I really struggle with calc but Carl is amazing at explaining things, he's always in a good mood, he's always down to help and answer questions. Even the CoE students who aren't in his class watch his lectures. We changed the GroupMe name to Carl Appreciation GC. If you have to take 1910, take it with him!; Awesome awesome awesome. Teach more classes Prof. Poitras! Get to his lecture even if it messes up your schedule.; What a good professor. Cornell needs more instructors like Prof. Poitras. Clear, fun, really talented instructor. The material isn't easy but you leave every lecture having understood the material so well that it makes reviewing my notes and doing the problems a breeze (with some work... lol). Thank you Prof. Poitras! Teach more classes!; Not caring. Did not bother to help us with the labs.; He seems like a nice guy, but he was a terrible professor for this class. He cancelled lectures 5 minutes before they were supposed to happen multiple times, the lecture material he presented had almost no relevance to the project we were working on, and he never seemed to know what was going on; Not the first class I have with Professor Poitras. Cornell needs more like him. He knows his stuff, is available, actually cares about his students. The course is a little heavy, we covered a lot of material, but thats why Im at Cornell. The material is current, the final project great.; Carl is a super nice dude, great lecturer and cares about his students.

Maybe the best I have had at Cornell. His courses are known to be phenomenal learning experiences, and 3150 was the best course I have had so far. But his courses are not easy and if you are not interested in the subject matter, life can become hard. And don't skip classes or fall behind - there is no catching up.; Rana has clear lectures and slides as long as you pay attention and dont sleep. Don't just only go to OH. Go to rana specifically for help understanding how to apply the concepts. Hes almost always free and there. He will help you.; Lectures are very clear and slides are well done. However, he makes the class revolve only around grades by always saying ""this can be on the final"" and publicly announcing top scorers on each assignment. Made me less interested in the subject.; Only cares about grades, he's a good lecturer but the constant focus on exams and grading instead of the actual subject ruined my enthusiasm for the subject.; okay so great teacher will give 5.0 for teaching... HOWEVER, it is a tad difficult. Also how could you make the final design night lab wednesday.... This is absolutely ridiculous in terms of timing. Why do so many of the students give him a 5.0 rating when they keep repeating difficult and tough grader? let me be an actual honest reviewer.; One of the best lecturers at Cornell. Clearly puts in a lot of effort into teaching his classes and conveys difficult subject matter lucidly. Homework assignments are difficult and time consuming, but doable, especially with his recitation sections. Exams are some of the hardest I've taken at Cornell (much harder than homework assignments).; Awesome in everything; This was by far the most difficult class I have taken at Cornell. Too much material was covered in a single course. And exams were also tough. But Rana is a super good lecturer, very sharp, clear,  and to the point. Almost scary. The course material was also organized extremely well (better than any book) and  I learnt a lot.; Rana looks mean but he is probs one of the nicest professors around. He made an otherwise difficult subject really lucid and he is super helpful with assignments. If you want a good grade, then the class would be a lot of work. Final was way easier than midterm, and grading was lenient. I recommend taking this class with him, if you can.; For the class that had so much material, Rana was really good at picking out the main points, stressing them, and without sacrificing any rigor.  The class was also structured very well, having good coverage of semiconductor physics and; Great lecturer! But extremely difficult material and even more difficult exams. If he wasn't a fairly generous grader, the median on our midterm would've been in the 30's. Through fairly generous grading, it ended up being in the low 60s.; I was impressed by the quality and clarity of the lectures,  handouts and homeworks. He exceeded my expectations. The course is rigorous and you need a broad background in physics to be able to fully appreciate the content.; This was the best class I have taken at Cornell so far. Rana is out of this world. He is the most eloquent and coherent professor in all of Cornell. Listening to him is like listening to Mozart - not a single word is out of place. Why aren't there more people like him in this world.; He is a terrific teacher, crystal clear, speaks a little too fast, but very hot!; Most awesome engineering professor. Teaches very clearly and extremely helpful. Physics-oriented solid state class. More recommended than the equivalent class in the AEP department.; He is one of the best teachers i have seen simply awesome; Extremely difficult, but I learned more in his class than any other; Tough class. Lots of his grad students.  Many students will try to take as many classes as they can.  Keep up with the mountain of work that you have to do and you'll be fine because he can explain semiconductors to a five year old perfectly.; Legendary.

This course does require a lot of work, so beware, but you learn the material from them and prelims are not that bad.; Prof Zhang is definitely not the worst professor out here; he does care about students. However, his lectures were extremely dry and he moves very fast. He knows his stuff, but this works to his disadvantage because he oftentimes forgets to explain the things that seem trivial to him but not to his students.; He's a really excellent lecturer and he makes jokes and plays games so we aren't bored all the time. He makes the material so much easier to understand. It's actually not a hard class and really interesting too, but it all builds up. Expect quizzes about 90% of the time.
